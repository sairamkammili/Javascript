JavaScript challenge practice time


There is a much easier way to run JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, no configuration needed:

Install the Code Runner Extension
Open the JavaScript code file in Text Editor, then use shortcut Ctrl+Alt+N, or press F1 and then select/type Run Code, the code will run and the output will be shown in the Output Window.
Besides, you could select part of the JavaScript code and run the code snippet. Very convenient!
